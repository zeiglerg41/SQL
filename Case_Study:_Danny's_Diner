-- 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
SELECT
	sum(menu.price) total_spent,
    sales.customer_id customer
FROM dannys_diner.sales sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT(sales.order_date)) days_visited,
    sales.customer_id customer
FROM dannys_diner.sales sales
GROUP BY customer
ORDER BY days_visited;
-- 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
SELECT 
	sales.customer_id,
    MIN(sales.order_date) ,
    sales.product_id
FROM dannys_diner.sales sales
GROUP BY sales.customer_id, sales.product_id
ORDER BY sales.order_date;
	
    	
   /*(SELECT menu.product_name product,
   MIN(DATE( Limit 1)
     FROM dannys_diner.menu
	 ORDER BY product ASC LIMIT 1) first_item_purchased */
-- 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
-- 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
-- 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
-- 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
-- 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
-- 9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
-- 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

-- Example Query:

    price
FROM dannys_diner.menu
